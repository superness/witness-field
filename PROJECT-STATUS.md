# Witness Field - Project Status

**Date**: December 6, 2024  
**Phase**: Emergency Fix Deployed - Planning True P2P Migration

## Current Status: EMERGENCY MODE ACTIVE ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ Emergency Fix Successfully Deployed
- **Memory crashes eliminated**: No more localStorage corruption
- **Cross-device sync working**: Witnesses appear between devices without refresh
- **Clean slate operation**: Fresh namespace prevents corrupted data issues
- **Emergency relay mode**: Using Railway relay server for immediate functionality

### üö® Architecture Issue Resolved (Emergency Fix)
**Root Cause**: Gun.js was storing ephemeral witness data in localStorage, causing:
- Exponential data growth (witness-v1 through witness-v1300+)
- localStorage hitting 5-10MB browser limits
- Memory crashes in both browser and Railway deployment
- Sync failures requiring page refresh

**Emergency Solution Implemented**:
```typescript
// witnessStore-emergency.ts
const gun = Gun({
  localStorage: false,   // CRITICAL: No localStorage
  radisk: false,         // No browser caching
  // Relay-only mode for immediate sync
});
```

## Current Architecture (Emergency Mode)

```
Browser A ‚Üê‚Üí Railway Relay Server ‚Üê‚Üí Browser B
    ‚Üë              ‚Üì                    ‚Üë
  Memory        Gun.js DB            Memory
 (witnesses)   (temporary)         (witnesses)
```

**Status**: Semi-centralized (relies on Railway relay server)

## Next Phase: True P2P Implementation

### Goal: Pure Browser-to-Browser Communication
```
Browser A ‚Üê‚Üí WebRTC Direct ‚Üê‚Üí Browser B
    ‚Üë                            ‚Üë
  Memory                      Memory
 (witnesses)                 (witnesses)
    ‚Üë                            ‚Üë
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Gun.js (peer discovery only) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: WebRTC Direct Data Exchange
- [ ] Use Gun.js ONLY for peer discovery (finding other browsers)
- [ ] Establish WebRTC DataChannels between browsers
- [ ] Exchange witness data directly via WebRTC (no server storage)
- [ ] Maintain witness data in browser memory only

#### Phase 2: True Ephemeral Architecture
- [ ] Witnesses exist only in active browser sessions
- [ ] Real-time broadcast of new witnesses via WebRTC
- [ ] Automatic cleanup when browsers disconnect
- [ ] No central server dependency for witness data

## File Structure

### Core Emergency Files
- `src/lib/witnessStore-emergency.ts` - Current emergency store (relay-only)
- `src/lib/witnessStore.ts` - Original store (disabled, has localStorage corruption)
- `ARCHITECTURE-DIAGNOSIS.md` - Detailed analysis of what went wrong
- `RECOVERY-PLAN.md` - Emergency and long-term solution plans

### Diagnostic Tools
- `src/routes/sync-test/` - Cross-device sync testing page
- `static/sync-test.html` - Standalone sync diagnostic
- `static/cleanup.html` - localStorage cleanup utility

### Configuration
- Emergency mode: `EMERGENCY_RELAY` (current)
- Target mode: `TRUE_P2P` (next phase)

## Technical Specifications

### Emergency Mode Limits
```typescript
const EMERGENCY_CONFIG = {
  maxWitnesses: 50,           // Hard limit
  expirationTime: 2 * 60 * 1000,  // 2 minutes only
  cleanupInterval: 30 * 1000,      // Clean every 30 seconds
  disableVersioning: true,         // No versioned copies
  disablePersistence: true         // No localStorage
};
```

### WebRTC Implementation Requirements
1. **Peer Discovery**: Use Gun.js signaling for WebRTC handshake
2. **Data Channels**: Binary witness data exchange
3. **Connection Management**: Handle peer join/leave events
4. **Memory Management**: Browser-only witness storage
5. **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation if WebRTC fails

## Success Metrics
- ‚úÖ No localStorage crashes
- ‚úÖ Cross-device sync without refresh
- ‚úÖ Memory usage under control
- ‚è≥ True P2P operation (no relay dependency)
- ‚è≥ Witnesses survive only in active sessions
- ‚è≥ No central server storing witness data

## Next Steps (Immediate)
1. **Analyze WebRTC requirements** for direct peer communication
2. **Design witness data flow** using WebRTC DataChannels
3. **Implement Gun.js peer discovery** without data storage
4. **Test direct browser-to-browser** witness exchange
5. **Migrate from emergency relay** to true P2P

## Deployment Status
- **Production**: Emergency fix deployed to thewitnessfield.com
- **Railway**: Relay server operational for emergency mode
- **Build**: Latest emergency fix in `build/` directory

**Current Emergency Fix**: Working reliably ‚úÖ  
**Next Milestone**: True P2P implementation without relay dependency  
**Risk Level**: Low (emergency fix provides stable foundation)
