# Witness Field

A minimalist, decentralized app for anonymous, ephemeral witnessings.

## Features

- **Anonymous**: No user accounts or persistent identity
- **Ephemeral**: Entries expire automatically after 24 hours  
- **Forkable**: Create new witnessings inspired by existing ones
- **Decentralized**: Uses Gun.js for peer-to-peer data sharing
- **Ambient**: No social metrics, clean interface focused on the content

## Tech Stack

- **SvelteKit** - Modern web framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Gun.js** - Decentralized real-time database
- **TypeScript** - Type safety

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## How It Works

1. **Submit a witnessing**: Share a moment, perception, or thought (140 char limit)
2. **View the field**: See other anonymous witnessings, fading as they age
3. **Fork**: Create your own witnessing inspired by another
4. **Watch them fade**: Entries automatically expire and disappear

## Philosophy

This is not a feed. Not a thread. Not a brand. It's a field.

A space for ambient thought-sharing without the pressure of social metrics or permanent records.
